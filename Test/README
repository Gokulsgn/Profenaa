Write a Python program that functions as a simple calculator using a while loop and menu-driven interface.

Your program should:

1.Display a menu with five options:

Add

Subtract

Multiply

Divide

Exit

2.Ask the user to enter a choice (1–5).

3.If the choice is from 1 to 4:

Prompt the user to enter two numbers.

Perform the selected operation using appropriate arithmetic operators.

Display the result in a formatted output like:
Result: 10 + 5 = 15

4.If the user chooses option 5:

Display a thank-you message and exit the loop.

5.Use a normal while loop (not while True) to keep showing the menu until the user chooses to exit.

6.If the user enters an invalid option, display:
"Invalid choice. Please enter a number from 1 to 5."

✳️ Note: For division, check that the second number is not zero. If it is, show:
"Error: Cannot divide by zero."
