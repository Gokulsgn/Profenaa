# **List Comprehension**

List Comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python using a single line of code.

It replaces traditional loops (like for or while) used for building lists.

It follows the format:

```
[expression for item in iterable if condition]

```
This improves readability, reduces code length, and often boosts performance.

✅ Basic Examples

```
# Create a list of numbers from 0 to 4
nums = [x for x in range(5)]  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# Square of each number
squares = [x*x for x in range(5)]  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]

```
