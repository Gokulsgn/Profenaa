## 📌 1. What is Python? (In-depth)

Python is a **high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language** created by **Guido van Rossum** in the late 1980s. Its design philosophy emphasizes:

- **Code readability**
- **Simplicity**
- **Rapid development**

### 🔍 Key Characteristics:

| Feature             | Description                                                |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Interpreted         | Runs line-by-line — no need to compile                     |
| High-Level          | Easy to read and write — close to human language           |
| Dynamically Typed   | No need to declare variable types                          |
| Garbage Collected   | Handles memory management automatically                    |
| Object-Oriented     | Supports OOP, inheritance, polymorphism                    |
| Functional Support  | Also supports functional programming                       |
| Extensible          | Can be extended using C, C++, and other languages          |
| Portable            | Runs on Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, Raspberry Pi, etc. |

## 📌 2. Deep Dive into Python’s History

| Year     | Milestone                                                                 |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1980s    | Guido van Rossum worked at CWI (Netherlands) on a language called **ABC** |
| 1989     | Started developing Python to overcome ABC’s limitations                   |
| 1991     | Released **Python 0.9.0** — included functions, exceptions, core data types |
| 2000     | Python **2.0** released — introduced garbage collection and list comprehensions |
| 2008     | Python **3.0** — Not backward compatible, improved syntax (`print()` etc.) |
| 2020     | Official retirement of Python 2                                           |
| 2023+    | Python 3.10 to 3.12+ — new features like pattern matching, speed boosts   |

> Not from the snake! Named after the British comedy show: **Monty Python’s Flying Circus**.

## 📌 3. Python’s Core Philosophy – The Zen of Python

The Zen of Python is a set of guiding principles for writing computer programs in Python:

```python
import this


The Zen includes:
Beautiful is better than ugly.

Simple is better than complex.

Readability counts.

There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it.

Errors should never pass silently.

If the implementation is hard to explain, it’s a bad idea.
